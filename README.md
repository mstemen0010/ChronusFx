JavaFx Elasped time keeper

Having a need for a elasped time keeper--to allow me to know how long I have been working on something--I also wanted it to be true "LED" 
styled "device" so  I built a custom LED Canvas object. This was originally created in Java Swing, then converted to JavaFx (hence the Fx in 
the name)
